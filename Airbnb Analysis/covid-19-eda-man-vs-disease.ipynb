When I explained that I was using his dataset and would stand to benefit from a revised version, he was kind enough to promptly update his dataset (which previously contained entries upto 19-01-2021) to include data upto the current date. If you haven't already, I strongly encourage you to upvote his dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/josephassaker/covid19-global-dataset). \n",

    "It has been over a full year since we started this difficult battle against Covid-19 and it has cost us dearly. These fast-spreading microscopic creatures that are too small to be even be seen with the naked eye have somehow shaken the entire world and changed life as we know it. \n",

    "People all over the world are racing against the clock to fight this pandemic. We, the bright minds of Kaggle can do our part by using our skills to generate powerful insight that can make the lives of those affected a little better. \n",

    "Every day, there's an abundance of data being made publicly available on Kaggle, each one containing different statistics surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal in this notebook, is to bring two such datasets together and generate a holistic view on how we, as a species have been fighting this virus. \n",

    "2. Numpy is a popular library used for array manipulation and vector operations. It is used extensively across python projects that require scientific computing.\n",

    "We see that so far, the Pfizer Vaccine and BioNTech have been making the fastest growth, most likely since this is the one that is prominently being adminstered in the USA which as we saw, is leading in terms of daily vaccinations. We also see rapid growth for CNBG, Sinovac, the prominent combination from China. We hope that very soon, as vaccinations become more easily accessible and affordable, all line graphs see an upward trend, matching that of USA and China. "
