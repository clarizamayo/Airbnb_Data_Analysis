    "[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) is the biggest player in the short-term rental market, with more than 7 million listings in over 220 countries. Over the years, its rampant growth and lack of transparency have made it a target for everything from charges of fueling overtourism and turning formerly residential neighborhoods into tourist zones to enabling raucous parties despite complaints and virus-related restrictions on gatherings. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The COVID effect\n",
    "The coronavirus has taken a massive toll on the travel industry, which in turn has created a major challenge for Airbnb. \n",
    "\n",
    "After laying off a quarter of its work force in the spring, Airbnb jettisoned some new ventures, including forays into transportation and entertainment, and hunkered down to focus on its core strength, lodging, even as its valuation fell from a high of \\\\$31 billion to, recently, \\\\$18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the fourth quarter of last year, Airbnb raked in \\\\$1.11 billion in revenue. But by the second quarter of this year, which covered the height of the pandemic, Airbnb’s revenue had dwindled to \\\\$334.78 million, down 72% percent year-over-year. The rising number of cancellations and slowing number of bookings ballooned Airbnb’s losses to \\\\$575.6 million in the second quarter, compared to a loss of \\\\$297.4 million during the same period one year prior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, prior to suffering any effects from the pandemic, the company lost \\\\$674.33 million, far greater than its \\\\$16.9 million loss in 2018. Meanwhile, in the first nine months of 2020, the company has already lost \\\\$696.9 million, more than during all of 2019. [source](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/airbnb-ipo-initial-public-offering-coronavirus-impact/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Study\n",
    "\n",
    "**The [current](https://www.kaggle.com/ivanovskia1/nyc-airbnb-rental-data-october-2017) NYC AirBnb Rental data October 2017 contains information about airbnb listings. It has it's location by latitute and longitude as well as the neighborhood,borough. It also has its price per night, amount of bedrooms, bathrooms ect.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our study is to explore data produced by airbnb listings and look for factors that might have contributed to Airbnb sucess. Futhermore, find out if we can find any patterns and predict the location and price of a listing. "

    "## Technology Stack\n",
    "In this analysis, we used python as the primary programming language because of its rich palette of tools that make data analysis a cinch. Some of the packages we used are:\n",
    "1. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an extremely versatile library of tools for generating interactive plots that are easy to interpret and customise.\n",
    "2. [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is a popular library used for array manipulation and vector operations. It is used extensively across python projects that require scientific computing.\n",
    "3. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) is another library for data science that is just as popular as numpy. It provides easy to use data structures and functions to manipulate structured data.\n",
    "4. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "5. [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.\n",
    "6. [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) makes it easy to visualize data that’s been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are well documented and come with several examples that make it easy to start using them. You can check out the linked documentation pages for more information."

    "In our first linear regression model, we tested the effect of the location (NYC 5 boroughs) on price (cost of airbnb listing) and found that the coefficient of determination was the lowest at around **0.04**. This might imply that price **doesn't** depend on which borough the listing is located in.\n",

    "The second linear regression model, which include all feautures mentioned in the hypothesis except borough, had a higher coefficient of determination of around **0.5**. From this, we can conclude that these features might not necessarily the strongest indicators but **do have** an effect on the price of an airbnb listing. \n",

    "tell the difference the boroughs which could be a sign of underfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In hopes to increase the accuracy of our prediction, we did another multinomial regression model. In the second model, we added an extra feature, minimun nights, and we increase the training size. Even though we increased the training size, the coefficient of determination decreased to **0.4774**. This could be due to having bias data to begin with. In other words, our data could contain all luxorious apartments in the boroghs which could mean that the apartment features of the listings are too similar and there is no way for our model to tell them apart. \n",
