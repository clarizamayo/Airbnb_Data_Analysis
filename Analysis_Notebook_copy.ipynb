    "The $52 rental with a $125 cleaning fee\n",
    "On Sept. 14, a Twitter user wrote, “Found a cheap @Airbnb for 52 dollars. Cleaning fee for 1 night, 125. Nonsense.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a typical complaint about the platform, which lists attractive nightly rates, but buries the fees until users begin booking. Cleaning and service fees can be modest — zero to $25, say — or add $450 to a booking, reflecting a mix of mandatory and optional host-applied fees. Sometimes there are additional occupancy taxes. And in some countries, Airbnb applies a Value Added Tax on its service fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under Airbnb’s pricing structure, hosts pay the company 3 percent of the booking subtotal, which includes the nightly rate plus any cleaning fee and fees for additional guests. Most guests are charged a service fee of less than 14.2 percent of the booking subtotal, which goes to Airbnb. (If hosts elect to cover the fee entirely, they normally pay Airbnb 14 to 16 percent of the subtotal.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue reading the main story\n",
    "Because of their variability and lack of transparency, fees are the latest financial facet users have fixated on after the company created its extenuating circumstances policy during the pandemic. It said that travelers who had reservations made on or before March 14 could cancel and not be subject to cancellation fees, even if, in their rental agreement, they were in the penalty period. The policy has been extended several times, now to Oct. 31. (While most guests were happy with the resolution, many hosts were not and Airbnb later apologized to hosts for not consulting them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb said it aims to introduce a redesign of price displays this year. “We’re trying to partner with hosts to create clear standards and change the search line, so if someone has higher cleaning fees, that affects their placement” in search results, Mr. Chesky said. “We’ve heard from travelers that they want a simpler way for us to show more of the price up front.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Reckoning with racial bias\n",
    "Four years before George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, igniting this summer’s protests for social justice, the emergence of the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack called attention to a spate of racist incidents that users said happened at rental homes. Some Black renters were reported by neighbors as thieves. Others were subject to abuse by racist hosts rejecting their bookings. Complaints by Muslim, transgender and other groups followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb worked to purge discrimination from its platform by hiding guest’s profile pictures until a booking is confirmed; hiring anti-discrimination specialists to audit the platform; and creating a reporting channel to identify listings not complying with its nondiscrimination policy. The company said it has removed 1.3 million offenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This month, Airbnb plans to launch Project Lighthouse, a research initiative in the United States that aims to measure bias through perception based on names and photos, to determine where and when bias happens on the platform, from booking through reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the company, the study has been in the works for two years in partnership with the racial justice organization Color of Change, with input from several social justice nonprofits, including Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s really hard to change what you can’t measure,” Mr. Chesky said. “Then hopefully we will use this data to continue to evolve our platform and reduce the bias.”\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest player in the short-term rental market, with more than 7 million listings in over 220 countries, is Airbnb. Over the years, its rampant growth and lack of transparency have made it a target for everything from charges of fueling overtourism and turning formerly residential neighborhoods into tourist zones to enabling raucous parties despite complaints and virus-related restrictions on gatherings. \n",
    "After laying off a quarter of its work force in the spring, Airbnb jettisoned some new ventures, including forays into transportation and entertainment, and hunkered down to focus on its core strength, lodging, even as its valuation fell from a high of $31 billion to, recently, $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb has touted privacy and guests’ control over their environment — including having your own kitchen in lieu of patronizing restaurants — as safeguards during the pandemic. It instituted new cleaning guidelines and indicated in late August that more than 1 million listings had earned the “Enhanced Clean” certification, which involves training in new guidelines that detail how and what to wash and sanitize. The procedures recommend 45 minutes of cleaning per room. Some listings guarantee a 72-hour vacancy window before check in.[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/travel/airbnb-pandemic.html)\n",

    "Venice and Florence demand a curb on Airbnb\n",
    "\n",
    "A 90-day limit for Airbnbs\n",
    "Urging the government to \"take a hold of the situation in a serious, forward-looking way,\" they suggest classifying all rentals of under 30 days as for tourism purposes, and imposing a limit of two such rentals on owners per city, and a 90-day annual limit for rentals.\n",
    "Many properties on Airbnb are owned by property investors who buy up handfuls of apartments to let in Italy's cities of art. They are often the cheapest, raising prices and squeezing locals out of the market.\n",
    "Those who own more than two properties, or rent them for more than 90 days, should register as a business, suggest the mayors -- at which point they would be subject to that tax regime which is three times more punitive.\n",
    "The cities are following in the footsteps of other overtouristed destinations including Paris, which allows people to rent out their primary residences for just 120 days a year; and Barcelona, which is mulling over a ban on short-term rentals.\n",

    "### The COVID effect\n",
    "The coronavirus has taken a massive toll on the travel industry, which in turn has created a major challenge for Airbnb. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the fourth quarter of last year, Airbnb raked in $1.11 billion in revenue. But by the second quarter of this year, which covered the height of the pandemic, Airbnb’s revenue had dwindled to $334.78 million, down 72% year-over-year. The rising number of cancellations and slowing number of bookings ballooned Airbnb’s losses to $575.6 million in the second quarter, compared to a loss of $297.4 million during the same period one year prior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, prior to suffering any effects from the pandemic, the company lost $674.33 million, far greater than its $16.9 million loss in 2018. Meanwhile, in the first nine months of 2020, the company has already lost $696.9 million, more than during all of 2019.

    "## Technology Stack\n",
    "In this analysis, we used python as the primary programming language because of its rich palette of tools that make data analysis a cinch. Some of the packages we used are:\n",
    "1. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an extremely versatile library of tools for generating interactive plots that are easy to interpret and customise.\n",
    "2. [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is a popular library used for array manipulation and vector operations. It is used extensively across python projects that require scientific computing.\n",
    "3. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) is another library for data science that is just as popular as numpy. It provides easy to use data structures and functions to manipulate structured data.\n",
    "4. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "5. [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.\n",
    "6. [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) makes it easy to visualize data that’s been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are well documented and come with several examples that make it easy to start using them. You can check out the linked documentation pages for more information."
